Introduction to Strings
Review


    A string is a list of characters.
    A character can be selected from a string using its index string_name[index]. These indices start at 0.
    A ‘slice’ can be selected from a string. These can be between two indices or can be open-ended, selecting all of the string from a point.
    Strings can be concatenated to make larger strings.
    len() can be used to determine the number of characters in a string.
    Strings can be iterated through using for loops.
    Iterating through strings opens up a huge potential for applications, especially when combined with conditional statements.
