2. Greetings
You are invited to a social gathering, but you are tired of greeting everyone there. Luckily we can create a function to accomplish this task for us. In this challenge, we will take a list of names and prepend the string 'Hello, ' before each name. This will require a few steps:

Define the function to accept a list of strings as a single parameter called names
Create a new list of strings
Loop through each name in names
Within the loop, concatenate 'Hello, ' and the current name together and append this new string to the new list of strings
Afterwards, return the new list of strings
Code Challenge
Create a function named add_greetings() which takes a list of strings named names as a parameter.

In the function, create an empty list that will contain each greeting. Add the string 'Hello, ' in front of each name in names and append the greeting to the list.

Return the new list containing the greetings.
