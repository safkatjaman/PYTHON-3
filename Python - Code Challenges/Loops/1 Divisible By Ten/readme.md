1. Divisible By Ten
Letâ€™s start our code challenges with a function that counts how many numbers are divisible by ten from a list of numbers. This function will accept a list of numbers as an input parameter and use a loop to check each of the numbers in the list. Every time a number is divisible by 10, a counter will be incremented and the final count will be returned. These are the steps we need to complete this:

Define the function to accept one input parameter called nums
Initialize a counter to 0
Loop through every number in nums
Within the loop, if any of the numbers are divisible by 10, increment our counter
Return the final counter value
Code Challenge
Create a function named divisible_by_ten() that takes a list of numbers named nums as a parameter.

Return the count of how many numbers in the list are divisible by 10.
