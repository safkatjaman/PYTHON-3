Block Letters

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters.

Write a Python program called initials.py that displays the initials of your name in block letters as shown and dip your toes into ASCII art.

Happy coding!

Tasks

What we are building in this project:

1.
Take a look at the complete alphabet and find your initials. Notice how each block letter is 7x5 and formed by the letter itself.

My initials are S and L, so my initials.py program should output:

      SSSS
    S      S
    S
      SSSS
           S
    S      S  
      SSSS
