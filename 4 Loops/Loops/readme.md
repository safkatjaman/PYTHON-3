Good job! In this lesson, you learned

How to write a for loop.

How to use range in a loop.

How to write a while loop.

What infinite loops are and how to avoid them.

How to control loops using break and continue.

How to write elegant loops as list comprehensions.

Letâ€™s get some more practice with these concepts!

Instructions
1.
Create a list called single_digits that consists of the numbers 0-9 (inclusive).


2.
Create a for loop that goes through single_digits and prints out each one.


3.
Before the loop, create a list called squares. Assign it to be an empty list to begin with.


4.
Inside the loop that iterates through single_digits, append the squared value of each element of single_digits to the list squares. You can do this before or after printing the element.


5.
After the for loop, print out squares.


6.
Create the list cubes using a list comprehension on the single_digits list. Each element of cubes should be an element of single_digits taken to the third power.


7.
Print cubes.

Good job!
