1. Every Three Numbers
Letâ€™s start our challenging problems with a function that creates a list of numbers up to 100 in increments of 3 starting from a number that is passed to the function as an input parameter. Here is what we need to do:

Define the function to accept one parameter for our starting number
Calculate the numbers between the starting number and 100 while incrementing by 3
Store the numbers in a list
Return the list
Code Challenge
Create a function called every_three_nums that has one parameter named start.

The function should return a list of every third number between start and 100 (inclusive). For example, every_three_nums(91) should return the list [91, 94, 97, 100]. If start is greater than 100, the function should return an empty list.
