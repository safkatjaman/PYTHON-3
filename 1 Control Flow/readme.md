CONTROL FLOW
===========
Boolean expressions are statements that can be either True or False

A boolean variable is a variable that is set to either True or False.

We can create boolean expressions using relational operators:

==: Equals

!=: Not equals

.>: Greater than

.>=: Greater than or equal to

<: Less than

<=: Less than or equal to

if statements can be used to create control flow in your code.

else statements can be used to execute code when the conditions of an if statement are not met.

elif statements can be used to build additional checks into your if statements

Letâ€™s put these skills to the test!
