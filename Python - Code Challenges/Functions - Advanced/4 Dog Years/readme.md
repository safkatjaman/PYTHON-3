4. Dog Years

Let’s create a function which calculates a dog’s age in dog years! This function will accept the name of the dog and the age in human years. It will calculate the age of the dog in dog years and return a string describing the dog’s age. This will require a few steps:

    Define the function called dog_years to accept two parameters: name and age
    Calculate the age of the dog in dog years
    Concatenate the string with the dog’s name and age in dog years
    Return the resulting string

Code Challenge

Some say that every one year of a human’s life is equivalent to seven years of a dog’s life. Write a function named dog_years() that has two parameters named name and age.

The function should compute the age in dog years and return the following string:

"{name}, you are {age} years old in dog years"

Test this function with your name and your age!
