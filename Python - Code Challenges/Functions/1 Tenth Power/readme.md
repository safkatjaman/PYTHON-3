1. Tenth Power

Letâ€™s create some functions which can help us solve math problems! For this first function, we are going to take the tenth power of a number. In order to do this we need to do three things:

    Set up the function header for tenth_power which accepts one parameter
    Take the tenth power of the input value
    Return the result

Code Challenge

Write a function named tenth_power() that has one parameter named num.
