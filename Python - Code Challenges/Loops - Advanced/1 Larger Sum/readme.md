1. Larger Sum

We are going to start our advanced challenge problems by calculating which list of two inputs has the larger sum. We will iterate through each of the list and calculate the sums, afterwards we will compare the two and return which one has a greater sum. Here are the steps we need:

    Define the function to accept two input parameters: lst1 and lst2
    Create two variables to record the two sums
    Loop through the first list and add up all of the numbers
    Loop through the second list and add up all of the numbers
    Compare the first and second sum and return the list with the greater sum

Code Challenge

Create a function named larger_sum() that takes two lists of numbers as parameters named lst1 and lst2.

The function should return the list whose elements sum to the greater number. If the sum of the elements of each list are equal, return lst1.
