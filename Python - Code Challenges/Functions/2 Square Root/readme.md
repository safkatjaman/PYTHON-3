2. Square Root

Another useful function for solving math problems is the square root function. We can create this using similar steps from the last problem. The code will look very similar. We need to:

    Set up the function header for square_root which accepts one parameter
    Take the square root of the input value
    Return the result

Code Challenge

Write a function named square_root() that has one parameter named num.

Use exponents (**) to return the square root of num.
